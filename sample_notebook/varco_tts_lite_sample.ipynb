    "VARCO TTS LITE is a low-latency, high-throughput engine for large-scale real-time speech synthesis. It offers a wide range of voices optimized for in-game characters—NPCs, avatars, and story narration—while keeping audio quality stable and consistent across sessions.\n",
    "\n",
    "To avoid issues often seen in AR (autoregressive) models, such as irregular pronunciation or instability in audio quality, the system tightly controls pitch, duration, and energy prediction, and applies deterministic synthesis to deliver the same quality every time.\n",
